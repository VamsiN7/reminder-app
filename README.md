# Getting Started

Below is a detailed development plan along with a recommended tech stack that aligns with your requirements for a fixed daily email schedule, in-app notifications, SMS reminders, and scalability for future features.

---

## **1. Project Overview**

**Goal:**  
Develop a reminder app that sends a daily countdown email to users until their graduation date, with additional in-app and SMS notifications as graduation approaches.

**Key Features:**
- **User Onboarding & Registration:** Simple signup process with essential info (name, email, graduation date, optional phone number).
- **Daily Email Reminders:** Automated emails sent at a fixed time each day with a personalized countdown.
- **In-App Notifications:** A notification center within the app for alerts.
- **SMS Notifications:** Key milestone SMS alerts as graduation nears.
- **Future Scalability:** Modular design for adding mobile push notifications, event calendars, and personalized to-do lists.

## **2. Tech Stack**

### **Frontend**
- **Framework:** React.js  
  - **Why?** Offers a dynamic and responsive user interface with easy component management.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap  
  - **Why?** Provides ready-to-use components and speeds up UI development.
- **State Management:** Redux (or Context API)  
  - **Why?** For managing global state, especially for user data and notifications.

### **Backend**
- **Runtime:** Node.js with Express.js  
  - **Why?** Excellent for building RESTful APIs and handling asynchronous tasks like scheduled emails.
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)  
  - **Why?** Secure and stateless authentication for API endpoints.
- **Scheduling:** Node Cron or Agenda  
  - **Why?** To trigger daily email reminders reliably at a fixed time.
- **APIs:** RESTful endpoints for user registration, notification management, etc.

### **Database**
- **Primary DB:** PostgreSQL  
  - **Why?** Relational data (user profiles, graduation dates, notifications) benefits from a structured schema.
- **ORM:** Sequelize (for Node.js)  
  - **Why?** Simplifies database interactions with models and migrations.

### **Third-Party Integrations**
- **Email Service:** SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES  
  - **Why?** For reliable and scalable email delivery.
- **SMS Service:** Twilio or Nexmo  
  - **Why?** Provides robust APIs for sending SMS notifications.
- **Push Notifications (Future):** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)  
  - **Why?** Easily integrates with mobile and web apps when you expand.

### **Deployment & DevOps**
- **Containerization:** Docker  
  - **Why?** Ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
- **Orchestration (Future):** Kubernetes  
  - **Why?** To scale microservices as your app grows.
- **Cloud Hosting:** AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku  
  - **Why?** Reliable hosting with scalable infrastructure.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or CircleCI  
  - **Why?** Automates testing and deployment pipelines.

### **Monitoring & Analytics**
- **Logging:** Winston or Morgan (for Node.js)  
  - **Why?** To log application activities and errors.
- **Analytics:** Google Analytics (for user behavior on the frontend) and custom backend logging  
  - **Why?** For monitoring engagement and tracking performance metrics.

## **3. Development Plan**

### **Phase 1: Planning & Design**
- **Requirements Gathering:** Finalize features, create user stories, and define acceptance criteria.
- **Wireframing & UI/UX Design:** Develop wireframes for the registration flow, dashboard, and notification center.
- **System Architecture:**  
  - Create a high-level architecture diagram.
  - Design the database schema (users, notifications, etc.).
  - Define API endpoints (e.g., `/register`, `/api/notifications`, `/api/countdown`).

### **Phase 2: Backend Development**
- **Setup Project:**  
  - Initialize a Node.js project with Express.
  - Configure ESLint, Prettier, and other development tools.
- **Database Integration:**  
  - Set up PostgreSQL and define models using Sequelize.
  - Create migration scripts for user data, notifications, and scheduling.
- **User Registration & Authentication:**  
  - Develop endpoints for user signup and login using JWT.
  - Implement email verification if needed.
- **Email Scheduler:**  
  - Integrate Node Cron (or Agenda) to schedule daily email tasks.
  - Connect with SendGrid (or chosen email service) to dispatch personalized countdown emails.
- **SMS Integration:**  
  - Integrate Twilio API for sending SMS notifications for key milestones.
- **API Documentation:**  
  - Use tools like Swagger or Postman for API documentation.

### **Phase 3: Frontend Development**
- **Initial Setup:**  
  - Scaffold a React application (using Create React App or Next.js).
  - Set up routing and global state management.
- **UI Components:**  
  - Develop components for registration, login, and the notification dashboard.
- **In-App Notifications:**  
  - Create a notification center that fetches and displays notifications from the backend.
- **Responsive Design:**  
  - Ensure the app is mobile-responsive and accessible.

### **Phase 4: Testing**
- **Unit Testing:**  
  - Use Jest (and Supertest for API endpoints) to write unit and integration tests.
- **End-to-End Testing:**  
  - Tools like Cypress for testing complete user flows.
- **Continuous Integration:**  
  - Set up CI pipelines to run tests on every commit (via GitHub Actions or similar).

### **Phase 5: Deployment**
- **Containerization:**  
  - Dockerize the frontend and backend applications.
- **Deploy:**  
  - Deploy on your chosen cloud provider.
  - Set up environment variables securely (API keys, database URIs, etc.).
- **Monitoring & Logging:**  
  - Implement logging and set up alerts for error tracking.
  - Use cloud monitoring tools (CloudWatch, New Relic, or similar).

### **Phase 6: Post-Launch & Future Expansion**
- **User Feedback:**  
  - Collect user feedback for future enhancements.
- **Analytics & Iteration:**  
  - Monitor user engagement and iterate on the notification frequency/content.
- **Feature Expansion:**  
  - Gradually introduce additional features like mobile push notifications, event calendars, and personalized to-do lists.
- **Scalability:**  
  - Refactor the code into microservices if needed, based on load and performance requirements.
